# Base Defenders

**Base Defenders** is a tower/base defense game written in **vanilla Java** and built using an **Entity–Component–System (ECS)** architecture.  
The project focuses on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and performance-friendly game loop design—without relying on external game engines.

## 🎮 Overview

- Defend your base against waves of enemies
- Place and upgrade defenses
- Manage resources and positioning
- Built from scratch in Java for learning and architectural control

This project is primarily a **learning-focused** and **architecture-driven** game, exploring:
- ECS design patterns
- Rendering and game loops in pure Java
- Decoupled systems and data-oriented design
